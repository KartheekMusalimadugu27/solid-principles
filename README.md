# SOLID-principles

S - Single Responsibility Principle
	[A class should have only one reason to change]

O - Open/Closed Principle
	[Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification]

L - Liskov Substitution Principle
	[Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program]

I - Interface Segregation Principle
	[No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use] 

D - Dependency Inversion Principle
	[1. High level modules should not depend on low level modules. Both should depend on abstractions]
	[2. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on Abstractions]
